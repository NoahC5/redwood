Welcome to [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com)!

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - Redwood requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>=14.19.x <=16.x) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.15)
> - Are you on Windows? For best results, follow our [Windows development setup](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/how-to/windows-development-setup) guide

Start by installing dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Then change into that directory and start the development server:

```
cd my-redwood-project
yarn redwood dev
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8910` to see the web app. Lambda functions run on `http://localhost:8911` and are also proxied to `http://localhost:8910/.redwood/functions/*`.
